## :bulb: Introduction
An application that provides real-time weather information according to the user's current location or a specific location by informing the name of the location.
First, a mobile application will be developed, using Flutter. Later, a web application will be developed, using Vuejs.

## :hammer: Project features
The app asks for permission to access the current location. If the permission is not granted, the user informs which city he would like to search. If the permission is granted, the app will return weather information for the user's current location.

After selecting the location, the app will display the following information:

 - Location name
 - Current temperature
 - Current date, maximum and minimum temperature for the current day
 - Hourly forecast
 - Daily forecast
 - Additional details about the current weather

In case the user wants to search for another location, there is a search option in the upper right corner.
